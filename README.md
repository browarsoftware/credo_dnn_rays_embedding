# credo_dnn_rays_embedding
This is a source code for the paper "Deep neural network architecture for low-dimensional embedding and classification cosmic ray images obtained from CMOS cameras" 
by Tomasz Hachaj, Marcin Piekarczyk and ≈Åukasz Bibrzycki. Source codes written by Tomasz Hachaj.

Requires: Python 3.6, Keras 2.4, Tensorflow 2.3 (GPU), JAVA for classification.

Train_model.py - main file for training DNN.

Generate_results.py - applies DNN to make embedding.

MakeClassification.java - uses files from Generate_results.py to make classification.

In order to run project download following files and change paths in source codes.
